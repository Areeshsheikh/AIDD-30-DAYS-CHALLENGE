**Q4: name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0?**

Antigravity

What it is: A new AI-powered coding workspace by Google.
What it does: Lets AI “agents” write run and test code almost on their own
Agents can access your code editor,terminal and browser to build apps run tests and check results
They also create reports and logs so you can track their work.
Why it’s useful: It acts like a smart coding partner, handling repetitive or complex coding tasks saving time and effort.

Gemini CLI / API

What it is: A command-line interface and API to interact with Gemini 3.
What it does: Developers can send instructions to Gemini 3 to generate code, automate tasks, or manage workflows
It can also integrate Gemini into other apps, scripts, or development tools.
Why it’s useful: Makes Gemini 3 programmable and flexible, allowing developers to automate coding and workflow tasks directly from their own tools.
