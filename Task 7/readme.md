What is SpecKit Plus?

SpecKit Plus is an implementation (or extension) of the methodology called Spec-Driven Development (SDD).
A workflow where instead of writing code first and treating specs as an afterthought, you define specifications first and let AI-powered agents generate code based on those specs.
SpecKit Plus is basically a clean way to build a software project without getting lost.
Instead of rushing into coding and fixing mistakes later, it helps you move slowly and clearly through five stages.
  Each step makes your idea clearer and the final result better.

1. Constitution:
    This is the starting point.
Here you set the main rules and expectations for your project. Think of it as deciding the “mindset” of your software.
This step sets the foundation for your project. You decide the rules, goals and overall direction. It defines how the project should behave and what standards to follow.

2. Specify:
    After the rules are clear. you explain what you want to build.This step is just you describing your idea in detail, in simple words.
Here you outline the features, purpose and functionality. This step makes your idea concrete and easy to understand.

3. Plan:
    Now that you know what you want, it’s time to figure out how you’ll actually make it.
You decide how the project will be built. You choose the tools, technologies and the overall structure. This step creates a roadmap that guides the development process.


4. Tasks:
    In this stage you break the entire project into small simple tasks.Instead of one big scary project you get many tiny steps like:
      Make the homepage
      Create the login form
      Add database connection
      Build search function
    Each task is easy to understand and easy to finish.This step is super helpful for both humans and AI because it removes confusion and keeps everything organized.

5. Implement:
    This is the final step where you actually start building the project.
Using the tasks you created earlier you write the code or let an AI agent write it for you. Because the previous steps were clear, coding becomes much easier and less stressful.
You just follow the tasks one by one until the whole project is complete.

       In short: SpecKit Plus helps you organize your project, think clearly, and build it step by step in a smooth and structured way.
