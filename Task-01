MY Reflection on AI-Driven Development(AIDD)


Today I learned what AI-Driven Development really means. For me, it means using AI to make coding easier and faster. Instead of writing everything by myself, AI can create the first draft of the code, and I just guide it and correct it. This makes development feel less stressful and more fun.
The 2025 Turning Point showed that AI is now a normal part of a developer’s work. Coding is no longer only about writing syntax. it’s about thinking, planning, and working together with AI tools.

I believe the future of Human–AI collaboration will be like teamwork. AI will help with the heavy work, and developers like me will focus on ideas, logic, and reviewing the AI’s output. I don’t think AI will replace developers it will support them.
Overall, AIDD makes me excited. It helps me learn faster and gives me confidence to build bigger projects with AI as my partner.
